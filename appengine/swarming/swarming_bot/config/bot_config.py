"""This file is meant to be overriden by the server's specific copy.

You can upload a new version via /restricted/upload/bot_config.

There's 3 types of functions in this file:
  - get_*() to return properties to describe this bot.
  - on_*() as hooks based on events happening on the bot.
  - setup_*() to setup global state on the host.

This file shouldn't import from other scripts in this directory except
os_utilities which is guaranteed to be usable as an API. It's fine to import
from stdlib.

Set the environment variable SWARMING_LOAD_TEST=1 to disable the use of
server-provided bot_config.py. This permits safe load testing.

This file contains unicode to confirm UTF-8 encoded file is well supported.

  The bot id will be automatically selected based on the hostname with
  os_utilities.get_dimensions(). If you want something more special, specify it
  in your bot_config.py and override the item 'id'.

  See https://github.com/luci/luci-py/tree/master/appengine/swarming/doc/Magic-Values.md.

  Can be used to implement per-bot authentication. If no headers are returned,

  "pre-warming" kind of stuff that could take several seconds to do, that would
  not be appropriate to do in on_after_task(). It could be worth waiting for
  `since_last_action` to be several seconds before doing a more lengthy
  operation.

  This function is called repeatedly until an action is taken (a task, updating,
  etc).

  This is a good place to do "auto reboot" for hardware based bots that are
  rebooted periodically.
