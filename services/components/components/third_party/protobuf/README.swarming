Name: Protocol Buffers - Google's data interchange format
Short Name: protobuf
URL: https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/
Revision: 525
Version: 2.5.0

Description:
Protocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data in an efficient yet
extensible format.

Local Modifications:
Kept only portion that is being shipped in an egg:

svn checkout http://protobuf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@525 protobuf
cd protobuf/python
./setup.py build
cp -r ./build/*/google .../services/components/components/third_party/protobuf/

Note that it needs working 'protoc' compiler in PATH. To build it:
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install

(or use './components/tools/install_protoc.py /usr')

Just copying trunk/python/google is not enough since it doesn't have necessary
*_pb2.py files ('./setup.py build' compiles them).
