# to almost completely get rid of transactions conflicts. This means that the
# probability of two transactions happening on the same shard must be very low.
# This relates to number of transactions per second * seconds per transaction /
# number of shard.

# Intentionally starve the canary server by using only 16Â³=4096 root entities.
# This will cause mild transaction conflicts during load tests. On the
# production server, use 16**5 (~1 million) root entities to reduce the number
