Isolate Server
==============

Contains the AppEngine code to store .isolated files and test data generated by
isolateserver_archive.py. isolateserver_archive.py is rarely used by itself, it
is usually used through isolate.py hashtable. See the design doc and main pages
for more information.

To test this code, first upload the changes to app engine as version test, and
then run main_test.py.
