Vitess
======

Vitess is a set of servers and tools meant to facilitate scaling of MySQL databases for the web.
It's currently used as a fundamental component of YouTube's MySQL infrastructure.

Features
--------

This is an incomplete list of Vitess features.

### Clients

* A Python DBAPI 2.0 compliant client interface.
* A go client interface.
* Simple [BSON](http://http://bsonspec.org/) based protocol with SASL
  authentication.

### vttablet

Smart middleware sitting in front of MySQL and serving clients
requests.

* Connection pooling.
* SQL parser: Although very close, the vtocc SQL parser is not SQL-92
  compliant. It has left out constructs that are deemed uncommon or
  OLTP-unfriendly. It should, however, allow most queries used by a
  well-behaved web application.
* Query rewrite and sanitation (adding limits, avoiding non-deterministic updates).
* Query consolidation: reuse the results of an in-flight query to any
  subsequent requests that were received while the query was still
  executing.
* Row cache: the mysql buffer cache is optimized for range scans over
  indices and tables, particularly when data is densely
  packed. Unfortunately, it’s not good for random access tables. The
  rowcache will instead maintain row based caches (using
  [memcached](http://memcached.org/) as its backend) and keep them
  consistent by fielding all DMLs that could potentially affect them.
* DML annotation: Every DML is rewritten to include a comment field at
  the end of a query identifying the primary key of the rows it
  changed.
* Integrated query killer for queries that take too long to return
  data.
* Discard idle backend connections to avoid offline db errors.
* Transaction management: Ability to limit the number of concurrent
  transactions and manage deadlines.
	  
### Management

* Cluster configuration is stored using pluggable lock service
  backends, with the [ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) enabled
  by default.
* *vtctl*: command line tool that allows to do most management
  operations, like initializing a server, changing its type, etc.
* Separate replication and serving graph management.
* *vtctld*: HTTP daemon giving an overview of the configuration
   (there's also a JSON API available).
* Fast database snaphsotting and reloading (much faster than mysqldump
  and LOAD DATA INFILE).

### Sharding 

* Keyspaces: All tables in a sharded database need to contain a “key”
  column. Vitess will use these values to decide the target shard for
  such data. All tables that are indexed by a set of keys are known as
  a *keyspace*, which basically represents the logical database that
  combines all the shards that store them.
* Range based sharding: The main advantage of this scheme is that the
  shard map is a simple in-memory lookup. The downside of this scheme
  is that it creates hot-spots for sequentially increasing keys. In
  such cases, we recommend that the application hash the keys so they
  distribute more randomly.

### Replication

* Split replication: replicate only part of the replication stream
  basing on provided criteria (useful for vertical or horizontal
  resharding).

### Tools

* *zkocc*: ZooKeeper connection pooler and cache.
* *zkctl*: manage ZooKeeper instances.
* *mysqlctl*: manage MySQL instances.
* *zk*: command line ZooKeeper client and explorer.

Dependencies
------------

* [Go](http://golang.org)
* [MySQL](http://mysql.com), we are working on
  [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) compatibility.
* [ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) or another lock service implementation.
* [Memcached](http://memcached.org)
* [Python](http://python.org) (for the client and testing).

Development
-----------

[Install Go](http://golang.org/doc/install).

``` sh
cd $WORKSPACE
sudo apt-get install automake libtool flex bison memcached python-dev python-mysqldb libssl-dev g++ mercurial git
go get code.google.com/p/opts-go
git clone git@github.com:youtube/vitess.git src/github.com/youtube/vitess
cd src/github.com/youtube/vitess
./bootstrap.sh
. ./dev.env
```

Optionally:

``` sh
VTDATAROOT=... #  $VTROOT/vt if not set
VTPORTSTART=15000
```

To run the tests:

``` sh
make  # run the tests
```
