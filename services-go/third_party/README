Contains all service agnostic utility packages that are third parties.

To add a third party, execute the following steps taking a project
"github.com/example/project" as an example:
  0. Get the 'goven' tool with: go get -u github.com/maruel/goven
  1. Fetch the project with: go get -u github.com/example/project
  2. Copy it here and fix imports with the goven tool:
       goven -extra third_party github.com/example/project
  3. Add third_party/github.com/example/project/README.swarming to note the
     git/hg revision used at the time of import.

goven is a tool to help import third party packages locally. What it does is to
copy the tree of files into the current directory, prefixed with the value
passed to -extra. Then it updates the imports for all .go files found in any
subdirectory of the current directory for imports to this project, and fix the
import to be to the new copied location. Visit https://github.com/maruel/goven
for more details.

TODO: Add automatic README generation that includes the revision of the project.
